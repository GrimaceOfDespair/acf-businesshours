Description
-----------

With this ACF extension you can edit business hours in a user friendly way.

This plugin is based on a fork of the
[ACF Field Type Template](https://github.com/elliotcondon/acf-field-type-template)
combined with an adapted version of the clever
[Business Hours plugin for jQuery](https://github.com/gEndelf/jquery.businessHours)
, topped off with a litte
[jQuery TimePicker](http://jonthornton.github.com/jquery-timepicker/).

The result looks like this:
